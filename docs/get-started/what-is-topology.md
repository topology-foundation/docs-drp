# What is Topology?

Most applications on the Internet rely on centralized intermediaries to manage user interactions. This limits user autonomy and interoperability across applications.

Programmable blockchains are decentralized platforms where users own the software they deploy, and where software interoperability is a core value. However, blockchains rely on consensus mechanism for strong consistency. Coordination among geo-distributed nodes creates severe limit on speed.

We believe the Internet of the future must be real-time by default and strongly decentralized. The design of Topology Protocol expresses such belief.

This documentation covers the most essential concepts - [Concurrency](./concurrency.md), [Hash Graph](./hashgraph.md), [Conflict](./conflict.md), & [CRO](./cro.md) - for developers to start building applications with Topology Protocol.
