## Overview

Topology Protocol is a distributed system protocol. It aims to **make the Internet real-time by default**.

Key properties of the protocol:
- **Low Latency**: Essential for real-time interactions
- **Decentralization**: Reduces single points of failure
- **Scalability**: Handles large amounts of concurrent users, and reduces coupling between independent applications
- **Eventual Consistency**: any change to an application is reflected in all its participants as fast as the network conditions permit
- **Security**: Robust against Byzantine actors - those who deviate from the protocol whether intentionally or not

It is useful for making applications where many users interact in real time. Examples include video games, social media, and collaborative tools.
